/// by a substring of the original string.

/// and is known not to change, operations which select a subset of
/// the elements can be computed eagerly, and in that case the
/// operation returns a new `Characters` object.

/// which allows iterating the independent characters in both directions,
/// but which also provides ways to select other ranges of characters
/// in different ways.
