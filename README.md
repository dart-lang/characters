`Characters` are strings viewed as sequences of *user-perceived character*s,
also know as [Unicode (extended) grapheme clusters](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries).

The `Characters` class allows access to the individual characters of a string,
and a way to navigate back and forth between them using a `CharacterRange`.
